# KJinstallations

Welcome to my webpage/portfolio for my AudioVisual Installation company. I love building things from scratch & I'm currently learning how to code (HTML, CSS, Javascript). My goal is to become a front-end developer, so I thought I'd gain some hands on experience by developing my very own webpage for my current business. Hopefully this will be able to help me find new opportunities within my field of work as well as build on my coding portfolio.
